- [Feature A]: [Brief description]
- [Flow B]: [Brief description]

### Out of Scope
List anything explicitly not being delivered now, and why.

- [Deferred Feature X] â€“ Out of scope due to [reason]

## 4. Goals & Objectives

- Goal 3: [Specific, measurable objective]

## 5. Target Users
- Who are the primary users?
- What are their needs and pain points?
- How will this feature improve their experience?

## 6. User Stories
Use the format: "As a [user type], I want to [do something], so that [benefit/value]."

### Primary User Stories
- As a [first-time user], I want to [easily sign up] so that [I can quickly start using the app]
- As a [returning user], I want to [resume where I left off] so that [I can continue work efficiently]
- As an [admin], I want to [see user activity logs] so that [I can audit system usage]

### Secondary User Stories
- As a [user], I want to [additional functionality] so that [additional benefit]

## 7. Requirements

### Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do.

- FR-1: Users can log in using email and password.
- FR-2: Admins can deactivate user accounts.
- FR-3: [Specific functionality requirement]

### Non-Functional Requirements
These describe how the system should behave (performance, security, reliability, etc.)

- NFR-1: System should respond to API calls in under 300ms.
- NFR-2: The system must support 99.9% uptime.
- NFR-3: All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

## 8. User Flow
Describe the key steps a user takes to complete the primary task(s). Use text, bullets, or link to a diagram.

- Start: [e.g., User lands on login page]
- Step 1: [e.g., Enters credentials and submits]
- Step 2: [e.g., System validates user]
- Step 3: [e.g., User is redirected to dashboard]
- End: [e.g., User can access their account]

Optionally, link to:
- User flow diagram (Figma, Lucidchart, etc.)
- Screens or wireframes supporting each step

## 9. Technical Considerations
Document any technical constraints, architectural decisions, or considerations relevant to engineering teams.

- What existing systems, services, or APIs does this feature rely on?
- Are there platform-specific concerns (web, mobile, backend)?
- Will this introduce new technologies, frameworks, or tools?
- What are the performance requirements?
- Are there security or compliance considerations?

### Dependencies
List any external dependencies this feature requires (APIs, teams, services, libraries).

- Dependency 1: [Description and purpose]
- Dependency 2: [Description and purpose]

## 10. Design & UI/UX
Link or describe the visual and interactive elements of this feature.

- Link to Figma mockups or prototypes
- Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Accessibility requirements (WCAG AA, etc.)
- Visual consistency with design system or style guide
- Status of design (e.g., WIP, final, awaiting review)

## 11. Data Model
Document any new data structures, schema changes, or models required for this feature.

- Describe new tables, collections, or objects
- Include key fields, types, and relationships
- Specify any schema changes to existing models

Optionally, link to:
- ERD or data flow diagrams
- Source-of-truth documentation or schema registry

## 12. Success Metrics
Define measurable outcomes that indicate whether the feature is successful.

- What user behavior or system outcome will prove this feature worked?
- Are there quantitative goals? (e.g., conversion rate, error reduction, engagement)
- How will you track or report these metrics?
- What is the baseline and target?

Examples:
- Increase sign-up conversion from 20% to 30%
- Reduce failed logins by 25%
- Maintain system response time under 300ms at 95th percentile

## 13. Testing Considerations
- What types of testing are required? (unit, integration, e2e, performance)
- Are there specific test scenarios or edge cases to cover?
- What are the acceptance criteria for this feature?

## Final Notes

1. Do NOT start implementing the PRD until all stakeholders have reviewed and approved
2. Ask clarifying questions if any section is ambiguous
3. Update the version number with each significant change
4. This document should be clear enough for junior developers to understand and implement

## Target Audience
This PRD is written for developers and product teams. Use clear, direct language and provide enough context for implementation without unnecessary business details.
